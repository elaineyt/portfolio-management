Meeting Participants:

Henry Cikanek

Changes to be made to Process:
Change “Create Account” to “Create User” on homepage 
Reintroduce background picture to main page
Add table layout to portfolio and historical trends + background to make it neat
Fix Coverage to encompass compound conditions
Test driven development was faulty since we ported over our old group30 repository and added complex hashing functionality
We need to prevent outlying commits for sustainable pace (had one large commit day)
Make sure we reflect on previous retrospective in the product backlog

Based on feedback from our demo, we need to fix a few UI changes (the first three bullet points). The next four bullet points are based on our sprint 2 grades. We need to fix coverage, test driven development, prevent extraneous commits for sustainable pace, and reflect on the retrospective in our product backlog.

Tasks that will be added to product backlog

Change “Create Account” to “Create User” on homepage 
Add background picture to main page
Add table layout to portfolio and historical trends + background to make it neat
