Why these task were chosen:

Taking into account our Sprint 2 Retrospective, we chose a fairly comprehensive task load as we seek to take the website into full functionality during this sprint while ironing out tests, refactors, and a few additional features. We are on track to complete login and logout functionality. As well as the graph and main page.
