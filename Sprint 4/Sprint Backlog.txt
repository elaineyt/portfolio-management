Why these task were chosen:
Since sprint 5 is only a few days long, we are aiming to fully implement our application this sprint so our sprint backlog is a mirror image of our product backlog. Our main focus for this sprint is acceptance tests (listed among each of the major features above) with a few additional components to each.
